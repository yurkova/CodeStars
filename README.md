# CodeStars

This repo provides solutions for [CodeStars](http://contests.techdays.ru/CodeStars/).

Each task folder contains file __ANSWER.md__ with the answer for a single task.

*__Important:__ Some tasks can have diverse input data. Be sure to check that your task variation matches the one from the __TASKS.md__. If it doesn't, you should use your input data to solve exactly your variant of the task.*

For better understanding of solving *Task05* without brute-force search, you may want to read [this article](http://www.ega-math.narod.ru/Quant/Tickets.htm#A2) about counting lucky tickets.

__Some errors (incorrect formulations of the tasks and rejections of the correct answers) were found. They are described in *TASKS.md* after corresponding task.__
