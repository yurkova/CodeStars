if you are a great fan of good old electro sound, that makes you go crazy, then you will definitely fall in love with the new album of rainbow socks. these four guys from the small village named chord hills became famous two years ago when their debut album "space music monsters" conquered the charts from all over the world with main single "lost in the stars" rocking key summer festivals. this year rainbow socks are presenting their new work "scream of the galaxy" where they continue exploring novel electronic sounds. james drummen, the frontman of rainbow socks, said that during the work on new album they were drawing inspiration from science fiction, reading tons of books about exploring the space. the guys tried to imagine what will be voices of  aliens and transmitted these exotic sounds in their tracks. one may say that it sounds weird, but when you listen to the main single "on the starship" you forget about everything and enjoy unusual combination of sounds of synthesizer, theremin, and drum-machine.
