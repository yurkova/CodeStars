# CodeStars

This repo provides solutions for [CodeStars](http://contests.techdays.ru/CodeStars/).

Each task folder contains file ANSWER.md with the answer for a single task.

*__Important:__ Some tasks can have diverse input data. Be sure to check that your task variation matches the one from the TASKS.md. If it doesn't, you should use your input data to solve exactly your variant.*

For better understanding of solving **Task05** without brute-force search, you may want to read [this article](http://www.ega-math.narod.ru/Quant/Tickets.htm#A2) about counting lucky tickets.
